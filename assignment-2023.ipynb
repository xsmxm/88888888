    "The goal of this assignment is to develop a Feedforward neural network for topic classification. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Text processing methods for transforming raw text data into input vectors for your network  (**1 mark**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Feedforward network consisting of:\n",
    "    - **One-hot** input layer mapping words into an **Embedding weight matrix** (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - **One hidden layer** computing the mean embedding vector of all words in input followed by a **ReLU activation function** (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - **Output layer** with a **softmax** activation. (**1 mark**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm with **back-propagation** to learn the weights of your Neural network. Your algorithm should:\n",
    "    - Use (and minimise) the **Categorical Cross-entropy loss** function (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - Perform a **Forward pass** to compute intermediate outputs (**2 marks**)\n",
    "    - Perform a **Backward pass** to compute gradients and update all sets of weights (**3 marks**)\n",
    "    - Implement and use **Dropout** after each hidden layer for regularisation (**1 marks**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss how did you choose hyperparameters? You can tune the learning rate (hint: choose small values), embedding size {e.g. 50, 300, 500} and the dropout rate {e.g. 0.2, 0.5}. Please use tables or graphs to show training and validation performance for each hyperparameter combination  (**2 marks**). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Re-train your network by using pre-trained embeddings ([GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)) trained on large corpora. Instead of randomly initialising the embedding weights matrix, you should initialise it with the pre-trained weights. During training, you should not update them (i.e. weight freezing) and backprop should stop before computing gradients for updating embedding weights. Report results by performing hyperparameter tuning and plotting the learning process. Do you get better performance? (**1 marks**).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extend you Feedforward network by adding more hidden layers (e.g. one more or two). How does it affect the performance? Note: You need to repeat hyperparameter tuning, but the number of combinations grows exponentially. Therefore, you need to choose a subset of all possible combinations (**3 marks**)\n",
    "\n",

    "- Provide well documented and commented code describing all of your choices. In general, you are free to make decisions about text processing (e.g. punctuation, numbers, vocabulary size) and hyperparameter values. We expect to see justifications and discussion for all of your choices. You must provide detailed explanations of your implementation, provide a detailed analysis of the results (e.g. why a model performs better than other models etc.) including error analyses (e.g. examples and discussion/analysis of missclasifications etc.)  (**10 marks**). \n",

Executing the whole notebook with your code should not take more than 10 minutes on any standard computer (e.g. Intel Core i5 CPU, 8 or 16GB RAM) excluding hyperparameter tuning runs and loading the pretrained vectors.

    "You are advised to follow the code structure given in this notebook by completing all given funtions. You can also write any auxilliary/helper functions (and arguments for the functions) that you might need but note that you can provide a full solution without any such functions. Similarly, you can just use only the packages imported below but you are free to use any functionality from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), NumPy, SciPy (excluding built-in softmax funtcions) and Pandas. You are **not allowed to use any third-party library** such as Scikit-learn (apart from metric functions already provided), NLTK, Spacy, Keras, Pytorch etc.. You should mention if you've used Windows to write and test your code because we mostly use Unix based machines for marking (e.g. Ubuntu, MacOS). \n",
